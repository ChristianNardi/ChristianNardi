Hi there! 👋

I'm Christian, a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate with a passion for programming, creative problem-solving, and exploring how technology connects us all. My academic journey has been filled with exciting challenges, like building a project that maps out a web of actors from IMDb—turns out, coding and cinema make quite the duo!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving open source projects

Beyond the world of algorithms and data structures, I’m an enthusiastic explorer of the arts. Whether it’s music, theatre, literature, freestyle, comedy, or a night at the movies, I find inspiration in every creative form. (And yes, I’m always up for a good football match or a debate about the greatest goals in history!)

I love bringing people and ideas together—whether through tech, storytelling, or a bit of both. If you want to talk code let’s connect!
